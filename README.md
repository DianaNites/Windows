# Windows

A planned library that never went anywhere. I don't even use windows anymore.

Open an issue on the github repo if you want ownership.

Given the limited amount of time contact details have been up for this crate, I don't plan to make a decision regarding ownership anytime soon. It is not first-come first-served.
